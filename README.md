# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This beginner-friendly project predicts customer churn (i.e., whether a customer will leave a service) using supervised machine learning. It includes end-to-end steps from data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction on new input.
